A Python Voice Assistant that answers questions about number of cases of COVID-19😷

## 📌Introduction
*“Stay Alert, Stay Safe”*

The **CoronaVirus Voice Assistant** is written in **Python**. The Voice Assistant responds with the *total number of cases* and *deaths* worldwide and for a particular country. You can ask a question like- “How many total cases in India?” or “How many total deaths?” and it will respond with the latest number of cases/deaths. Built using the SpeechRecognition module and the Python text-to-speech (pyttsx3) module, it uses Regex pattern matching to respond with correct data by identifying keywords. The program updates to fetch the latest data when the command "UPDATE" is called out.

## 👩‍💻 How is it made?

* For this project I used ParseHub for web-scraping.
* The website for collecting the data is [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
* Python Speech Recognition
* Python text to speech
